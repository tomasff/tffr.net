I'm Tom√°s Fernandes, a computer scientist at the University of Warwick.

I'm particularly interested in distributed systems and advancements towards more general-purpose machine learning models (see the [Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data)).
More recently, I've also developed an interest in [graph](https://neo4j.com/) and [time-series](https://www.timescale.com/) databases, and [machine learning on graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/).

Last summer, I was a software engineering intern in the [Manhattan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgSDOZpOQg) team at {{< icon "twitter" >}} Twitter (Twitter's real-time, multi-tenant distributed database), my first experience with large-scale distributed systems spanning multiple data-centers and tens of thousands of nodes. This experience shaped my interest in distributed systems and databases,
leading to my first talk ["Making Servers Gossip"](/talks).

In my spare time, I build projects to explore my interests and new technologies - [see more](/projects).
