I'm Tom√°s, a computer scientist & software engineer at Coinbase particularly interested in software engineering, distributed systems,
geometric deep learning (e.g. [GATr](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18415.pdf)),
interpretability, computer vision, and general purpose architectures (e.g. [Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data)).
