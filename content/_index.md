I'm a computer scientist at the University of Warwick particularly interested in distributed systems and multi-modal machine learning (e.g. [Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data)).
More recently, I've also developed an interest in [machine learning on graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/), and
[time-series](https://www.timescale.com/) & [graph](https://neo4j.com/) databases.
