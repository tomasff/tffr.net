I'm Tomás, a computer scientist & software engineer at Coinbase particularly interested in software engineering, distributed systems,
geometric deep learning, and general purpose architectures (e.g. [Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data)).

I operate [`AS203504`](https://bgp.tools/as/203504#asinfo) which originates the prefix `2a0c:9a40:89f0::/48`.
