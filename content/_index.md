I'm Tom√°s, a computer scientist & software engineer at Coinbase particularly interested in software engineering, distributed systems,
geometric deep learning (e.g. [GATr](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18415.pdf)),
interpretability, computer vision, and general purpose architectures (e.g. [Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data)).

I host a [mirror](ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dm0wdc8z7xp6a0952h7yhnv9e0wz0ysz6mrwnujm78ym4eylx9u) of this website on the <i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech/).
